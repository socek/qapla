# About

This project is pyramid's boilerplate code for applications. It is useful when you have couple of application using
pyramid and want to have the same code structure and similar configuration.
"Qapla'" is a Klingon's world for "success".

# Features

1. Controller as a class instead of methods with a simple flow and configuration from class properties
2. 4 controller types:
 * Controller (return templates)
 * JsonController (return json)
 * RestfulController (designed for restfull apps)
 * FormController (designed for form validation in restfull apps)
3. Boilerplate for
 * Integration with morfdict (settings)
 * Integration with Sqlalchemy and Alembic
 * Testing fixtures for py.test
 * Logging integration with morfdict's settings

# Installation

```
pip install qapla
```

You should add "qapla==0.1" into you requiretment's list (either if you have requiretments.txt or in setup.py). Please
be aware that qapla versions will not be backward compatible, so you need to use fixed version instead of something like
"qapla>=0.1". Qapla have no fixed version for it's requiretment so please also be aware that after upgrading for example
pyramid, the qapla can stop working. So you should fix the pyramid's version in your application.

# How to use

Qapla is designed to use it's features separately.

## Application boilerplate + settings integration

Example Application class is looking like this:

```python
from qapla.app import Application
class RotarranApplication(Application):

    class Config(Application.MetaConfig):
        settings_module = 'rotarran.application'

    def append_app_plugins(self):
        self.add_logging()

    def append_web_plugins(self):
        self.add_routing(CCAdsRouting)
        self.add_auth(
            AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy,
            ACLAuthorizationPolicy,
            CCAdsFactory)
        self.add_session(SignedCookieSessionFactory)
        self.add_csrf_policy(SessionCSRFStoragePolicy)

main = RotarranApplication()
```

First we need to create Application class. Application.MetaConfig.settings_module is python url for where the settings
will be stored (morfdict support configuration in many files, for example "default.py" + "local.py"). After that we
should add some plugins. In this example we add plugins for:
- routing - which comes with routing as .yml file
- auth
- session
- csrf

All these plugins can be configured in normal pyramid way.
The "main" variable is for pyramid's configuration. This is the object which needs to be configured when creating egg
for the pyramid's application, example:

```python
setup(
    name='rotarran',
    packages=find_packages(),
    entry_points={
        'paste.app_factory': [
            'main = rotarran:main'
        ],
    }
)
```

### Sqlalchemy and alembic integration

This section was moved to the [README-database.md](README-database.md).

### Logging

Logging is configured by default's Python logging support.
https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/logging.config.html#logging.config.dictConfig
This is an example.

```
def logger(settings, paths):
    log_level = environ.get('CCADS_LOGGING_LEVEL', 'INFO')
    settings.set(
        'logging',
        {
            'version': 1,
            'disable_existing_loggers': True,
            'formatters': {
                'generic': {
                    'format': '%(asctime)s %(levelname)-5.5s [%(name)s][%(threadName)s] %(message)s',
                },
            },

            'handlers': {
                'console': {
                    'level': log_level,
                    'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
                    'formatter': 'generic',
                },
            },

            'loggers': {
                'root': {
                    'level': 'INFO',
                    'handlers': ['console'],
                },
                'sqlalchemy': {
                    'level': 'INFO',
                    'handlers': ['console'],
                    'qualname': 'sqlalchemy.engine',
                    'propagate': '0',
                },
                'alembic': {
                    'level': 'INFO',
                    'handlers': ['console'],
                    'qualname': 'alembic',
                    'propagate': '0',
                },
            }
        })
```

After that you need to call add_logging in the append_app_plugins method.

```
class RotarranApplication(Application):
    def append_app_plugins(self):
        self.add_logging()
```

## Controller

### flow

Qapla's controller is very simple.

```python
from qapla.controller import Controller

class HomeController(Controller):

    renderer = 'path/to/template.jinja2'

    def make(self):
        self.context['yey'] = 'it worked!'
```

This sample controller will render html from template using context. There is no
more magic behind this. Configuration by class properties works only if you use
qapla.routing.Routing for your routing configuration.

Flow of running the controller
1. `_create_context()` - create default context
2. `_before_make()` - do some stuff before make
3. `_make()` - run .make method
4. `_after_make()` - do some stuff after make
5. `_create_widgets()` - add something into the context
6. `_get_response()` - return prepered response or create new one if not created

Before and after make methods are places to make something like "context processor"
in django (code which will be runned around normal controller code). In order
to proper use of these you need to inherite from controllers with these method
overwritten.

`_make method` is a wrapper for .make which, besides running .make, will catch
FinalizeController error. This is an error which will end the .make method, but
run the rest of the controller flow. Another useful error is QuitController,
which will end the request without finishing the controller flow. FinalizeController
will run `._after_make` and `._create_widgets` method, but `QuitController` will not.

If you will not create response object, the default one will be used. If you would
like to create response, you need to set Controller.response property, for example:

```python
self.response = HTTPFound(
    location=url,
    headers=self.request.response.headerlist,
)
```

`_create_widgets` method will be called only, if you have no response created in the
.make mthod.

### Controller helpers

.redirect method will make HTTP 302 redirection response. If you use quit=True,
then this method will raise QuitController.

### JsonController

This controller will return json (generated from .context) instead of rendered
template.

### RestfulController

This controller will return json and have proper HTTP REST method to use within
the controller:

1. def get(self):
2. def post(self):
3. def put(self):
4. def patch(self):
5. def delete(self):

## Routing

Routing is a wrapper for pyramid's default router. It is designed to use in the
most common way: adding route for controller. Pyramid's url dispatching is
configured in two steps

- configure url
- configure controller

It is made that because controller can habdle more then 1 url. Qapla's router
simplyfi this flow, so one url == one controller. Also this router will try to
read the @view_config configuration from the controller's class attributes.

Route.add method is for adding the url and controller.
- controller: controller class
- route: name for the route
- url - url pattern

Reading from yaml is very simple, because each entry is interpreted as call for
the .add method, where controller arg is dotted url for the controller class.
By using named entries you will configure a prefix for controller dotted url.
Example:

```yaml
rotarran.auth.controllers:
  -
    controller: LoginController
    route: auth:login
    url: /auth/login
  -
    controller: LogoutController
    route: auth:logout
    url: /auth/logout
  -
    controller: AuthDataController
    route: auth:data
    url: /auth
  -
    controller: RegistrationController
    route: auth:registration
    url: /auth/registration
```

Router class is designed to be used by inherit it and overwrite the .make method,
and there it will be configured.
Example:

```python
from qapla.routing import Routing


class RotarranRouting(Routing):

    def make(self):
        super().make()
        self.read_from_file(self.paths.get('app:auth:routing'))
        self.read_from_file(self.paths.get('app:home:routing'))
        self.read_from_file(self.paths.get('app:menu:routing'))
        self.read_from_file(self.paths.get('app:wallets:routing'))
```

Adding this routing to the application is done by adding like other plugins.

```python
class RotarranApplication(DatabaseApplication):

    def append_web_plugins(self):
        self.add_routing(RotarranRouting)
```
